Link to the guide on Openliberty.io: https://openliberty.io/guides/retry-timeout.html

This repo provides an interactive guide on the Openliberty.io website that users can interact with and learn more about different concepts related to Open Liberty.

## What you'll learn:

Explore how to use MicroProfile Timeout and Retry policies from the Fault Tolerance feature to make your microservice more resilient to common failures like network problems or an IOException.

You'll start with a sample bank scenario and experience a network glitch. You'll then enable MicroProfile Fault Tolerance and use the Timeout policy to quickly fail requests that are hanging for too long. Finally, you'll explore the Retry policy and how it can help overcome temporary intermittent failures your application might experience.
